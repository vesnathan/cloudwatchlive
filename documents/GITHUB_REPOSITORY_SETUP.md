## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by opening a private security advisory:

3. Provide details about the vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest version on the `main` branch.

## Security Best Practices

This project follows AWS security best practices:
- All API requests require authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Environment variables are never committed to the repository
- AWS credentials are stored securely and rotated regularly
```

## Secrets (for GitHub Actions)

Navigate to: **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**

### Repository Secrets

Add these secrets for CI/CD workflows:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key for deployments
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret key for deployments
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (e.g., ap-southeast-2)
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` - AWS account ID

**Note**: Never commit these values to the repository. Only store them in GitHub Secrets.

## GitHub Actions Workflows (Future)

- `deploy-dev.yml` - Deploy to dev environment on push to `dev`
- `deploy-prod.yml` - Deploy to production on push to `main`

## Repository Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Review Dependabot security alerts weekly
- Clean up stale branches after merges
- Review and respond to bug reports
- Update documentation as features change

### Git Workflow
1. Feature branches created from `dev`
2. PRs submitted to `dev` for testing
3. After testing and approval, merge `dev` to `main` for production
4. Tag releases on `main` branch: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
